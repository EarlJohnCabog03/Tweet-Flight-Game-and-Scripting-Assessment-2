Welcome to Tweet Flight, a fast-paced, wing-flapping adventure through the skies!
Take control of a chirpy little bird on a mission to dodge skyscrapers, soar past clouds, and stay airborne for as long as possible.

                                                      Features:
One-Tap Controls: Simple to learn, hard to master.

Retro Pixel Art: Classic 8-bit style visuals that bring nostalgia to life.

Endless Challenge: The further you go, the faster it gets!

High Score System: Beat your best and challenge your friends.

                                                              How to Play:
Tap the screen (or spacebar on keyboard) to flap your wings and stay in the air. Avoid hitting buildings and the ground. One mistake, and it's game over!
